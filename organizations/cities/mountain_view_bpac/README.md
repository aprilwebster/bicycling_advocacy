## Mountain View Bicycling-Related Plans

## Capital Improvement Plan (CIP)

### What is it?
A CIP "contains all the individual capital projects, equipment purchases, and major studies for a local government; in conjunction with construction and completion schedules, and in consort with financing plans. The plan provides a working blueprint for sustaining and improving the community’s infrastructures. It coordinates strategic planning, financial capacity, and physical development. A CIP stands at the epicenter of a government’s Planning, Public Works, and Finance departments." (Source: https://opengov.com/article/capital-improvement-plans-101)

There are two parts: 
   1. Capital budget: spending plan for the next year
   2. Capital program: plan for expenditures beyond the budget timeframe (5-10 years)
