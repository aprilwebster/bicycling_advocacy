## Mountain View Bicycling-Related Plans

## Capital Improvement Plan (CIP)

### What is it?
A CIP "contains all the individual capital projects, equipment purchases, and major studies for a local government; in conjunction with construction and completion schedules, and in consort with financing plans. The plan provides a working blueprint for sustaining and improving the community’s infrastructures. It coordinates strategic planning, financial capacity, and physical development. A CIP stands at the epicenter of a government’s Planning, Public Works, and Finance departments." (Source: https://opengov.com/article/capital-improvement-plans-101)

There are two parts: 
   1. Capital budget: spending plan for the next year
   2. Capital program: plan for expenditures beyond the budget timeframe (5-10 years)

#### Goal
Provide a consistent vision for the City's multimodal transportation network. Building on more than thirty existing local and regional transportation plans and studies, AccessMV aims to identify the City's primary transportation network for all modes, and prioritize previously identified transportation improvement projects. 

#### Outcome
Proposed prioritization criteria have been developed to identify priority corridors and transportation projects in the City of Mountain View.

#### Prioritization variables
bicycle level of traffic stress
pedestrian quality of service
potential transit demand. 
network overlaps inconsistencies, and gaps between the different plans and studies. 

#### Community Outreach
- Mountain View Bicycle/Pedestrian Advisory Committee (B/PAC) meeting on September 30, 2020
- Virtual community meeting: October 22, 2020, members of the public provided proposed prioritization goals and criteria via a virtual community meeting
