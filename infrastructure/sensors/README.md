### Loop Sensors in the Bay Area
- Santa Clara - doesn't use push buttons
- Mountain View - loops sensors break and it's difficult to check if they are; the only way is through community feedback
- San Jose 
   - the bike symbol indicating a bike sensor is misleading as it was unintentionally used at intersections where there weren't any sensors
   - most progressive in Bay Area in terms of bike signal/sensor technology

### Trends in loop sensors
- Video sensors is what's the new technology that's getting used
   - touchless
   - easier to debug, fix
- blue lights to provide user feedback of sensor activation
