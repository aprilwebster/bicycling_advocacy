### Resources
- [Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/)
   - national standards on traffic control
- [California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (CAMUTCD)](https://dot.ca.gov/programs/safety-programs/camutcd)
   - California developed its own, more strict set of standards
   - in the document, new sections are in blue font and national standards are crossed out if California has a more specific (or different) standard
- trafficpatterns.net
   - Jaime Rodriguez's company
   - used to be Director of Public Works in Palo Alto
- [VTA Bicycle Technical Guidelines](https://www.vta.org/sites/default/files/documents/vta_bicycle_technical_guidelines_complete.pdf)
   - this document was the first of its kind in the Bay Area and informed/educated cities in the Bay on how to build bike infrastructure
   - good resource to understand the requirements on the Bay's earlier bike lanes
   - published in 2012; things have changed since then and it was already outdated at the time it was published
   - very good examples from various cities in the Bay area

### Loop Sensors in the Bay Area
- Santa Clara - doesn't use push buttons
- Mountain View - loops sensors break and it's difficult to check if they are; the only way is through community feedback
- San Jose 
   - the bike symbol indicating a bike sensor is misleading as it was unintentionally used at intersections where there weren't any sensors
   - most progressive in Bay Area in terms of bike signal/sensor technology
   
- 

### Trends in loop sensors
- Video sensors is what's the new technology that's getting used
   - touchless
   - easier to debug, fix
- blue lights to provide user feedback of sensor activation
   - examples:
