## Document Conventions & Definitions
### OPTIMUM, SHOULD AND SHALL
- “optimum” = optimal design guidelines for bikeways and for roadways where bicycles are permitted. In these
   - best or most favorable condition from the perspective of the safety and convenience of the typical bicyclist expected to use the facility
   - motivation for including optimum: set high expectations, build projects to higher design standards, improve the quality of bicycle facilities and encourage bicycling as a transportation mode
- “should” = practice would result in optimum conditions for bicyclists
- “shall” = State or Federal mandatory design standard.

## Chapter 6: Signalized Intersections
### 6.1.3: Progression
- Commercial districts and Central Business Districts (CBD’s)
   - signals should be timed for **bicycle speeds approximately 12 to 15 miles per hour**. 
- Arterial roads
   - often timed to maximize automobile throughput (fuel savings + auto-travel time benefits). Although this has positive benefits for fuel savings and
   - A signalized arterial could be coordinated for bicycle speeds rather than motor vehicle speeds as has been done in Portland, Oregon where **downtown streets are timed at 14 mph**
- My Comments (AW)
   - Interesting that the speed is 12-15mph; this is a speed I travel at when on a road-bike cycling at a moderate speed for exercise purposes
   - This doesn't seem a reasonable speed for a wider class of bicyclists with differing degrees of comfort, fitness and purpose of travel

### 6.2: Traffic Signal Detection
- At actuated signals, the detection technology **must** be able to detect a bicycle. 
   - particularly imperative at intersections with major street recall, i.e. where minor streets only receive the green signal upon the detection of a vehicle. 
- Bicycle detection is also important at left-turn lanes with protected left-turn phasing. 
   - Without, bicyclist is forced to do one of the following: 
      - wait for a motor vehicle to arrive and trigger the light
      - dismount to push the pedestrian button (if there is one) or proceed on a red light.

#### Caltrans Standard
- New or modified detector installations **must** detect bicycles on all approaches and movements or be placed on permanent recall or fixed time operation. See MUTCD-CA § 4D.105. Also refer to CVC §21450.5.

## General Definitions - TBA
