## Lane widths
https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/street-design-elements/lane-width/
- Lane widths of 10 feet are appropriate in urban areas and have a positive impact on a streetâ€™s safety without impacting traffic operations.

- Good article with quotes re the benefit of 10 ft lanes: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-06/why-12-foot-traffic-lanes-are-disastrous-for-safety-and-must-be-replaced-now 
   - "When lanes are built too wide, pedestrians are forced to walk further across streets on which cars are moving too fast and bikes don't fit."

## Road diet

#### 3.3.5 Average Daily Traffic (ADT)
- The ADT provides a good first approximation on whether or not to consider a Road Diet conversion. 
   - If the ADT is near the upper limits of the study volumes, practitioners should conduct further analysis to determine its operational feasibility. This would include looking at peak hour volumes by direction and considering other factors such as signal spacing, turning volumes at intersections, and other access points. 
   - Each practitioner should use engineering judgment to decide how much analysis is necessary and take examples from this report as a guide.
- Examples:
   - A 2011 Kentucky study showed Road Diets could work up to an ADT of 23,000 vehicles per day (vpd).35
   - In 2006, Gates, et al. suggested a maximum ADT of between 15,000 and 17,500 vpd.36
   - Knapp, Giese, and Lee have documented Road Diets with ADTs ranging from 8,500 to 24,000 vpd.37 
- The FHWA advises that roadways with ADT of 20,000 vpd or less may be good candidates for a Road Diet and should be evaluated for feasibility. 
- Figure 12 shows the maximum ADTs used by several agencies to determine whether to install a Road Diet. Road Diet projects have been completed on roadways with relatively high traffic volumes in urban areas or near larger cities with satisfactory results.
