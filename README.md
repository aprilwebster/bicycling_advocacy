## Laws
### Dutch Reach
### Stop-As-Yield and Red-As-Stop
#### Description
Under a Stop as Yield law, when a cyclist approaches an intersection controlled by a stop sign, the cyclist must still stop if there is approaching cross-traffic with the right of way. However, if there is no approaching cross-traffic with the right of way, the cyclist is not required to stop, and may instead roll past the sign and enter the intersection. This is exactly how a yield sign works, which is why the law is called “Stop as Yield.”

It is also known as the safety or rolling stop and as the "Idaho stop" (which also adds Red as Stop) as it was the first state to introduce the law, back in 1982.





#### Locations
- Arkansas: 
- Colorado
   - 2011: the cities of Dillon and Breckenridge passed Stop as Yield laws
   - 2012: Summit County passed Stop as Yield law for its unincorporated areas
   - 2014: the City of Aspen passed a Stop as Yield law
   - 2018: [SB18-144](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb18-144) which provides recommended language for the Stop as Yield law, which each individual city or county may now adopt at its option; this is NOT a state law
      ```
      The act permits a municipality or county to regulate the operation of bicycles approaching intersections with stop signs or illuminated red traffic control signals. 
      Under a local regulation, a bicyclist approaching a stop sign must slow to a reasonable speed and, when safe to do so, may proceed through the intersection without 
      stopping. A bicyclist approaching an illuminated red traffic control signal must stop at the intersection and, when safe to do so, may proceed through the intersection.
