## Legislation
### Dutch Reach
### Stop-As-Yield and Red-As-Stop
#### Description
Under a Stop as Yield law, when a cyclist approaches an intersection controlled by a stop sign, the cyclist must still stop if there is approaching cross-traffic with the right of way. However, if there is no approaching cross-traffic with the right of way, the cyclist is not required to stop, and may instead roll past the sign and enter the intersection. This is exactly how a yield sign works, which is why the law is called “Stop as Yield.”

It is also known as the safety or rolling stop and as the "Idaho stop" (which also adds Red as Stop) as it was the first state to introduce the law, back in 1982.





#### Locations
- Arkansas: 
- Colorado

   - 2018: [SB18-144](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb18-144) which provides recommended language for the Stop as Yield law, which each individual city or county may now adopt at its option; this is NOT a state law
      ```
      The act permits a municipality or county to regulate the operation of bicycles approaching intersections with stop signs or illuminated red traffic control signals. 
      Under a local regulation, a bicyclist approaching a stop sign must slow to a reasonable speed and, when safe to do so, may proceed through the intersection without 
      stopping. A bicyclist approaching an illuminated red traffic control signal must stop at the intersection and, when safe to do so, may proceed through the intersection.

## Bike Crashes
### Involving a Car
#### Nov 16, 2020: Menlo Park (Melville Ave at Middlefield Road)
My son was riding his bike and got hit by a car on Monday, November 16, 2020 around 10am on the corner of Melville Avenue and Middlefield Road.  I rushed him to the ER and luckily, he got away with only a badly sprained wrist, a bad cut on his knee and some bruises on both legs. My son let me know that the driver helped pick up his bike, asked if he was ok and then left.  The driver never asked to call me or the police.  My son described the driver as a Caucasian male in his 60’s or 70’s, bald head, white beard and circular glasses.  My son also let me know that he drove the same car and color as my daughter which may have been a 2006 beige Honda Civic. There is an active police report so any and all information is helpful."
